===   What does "WhatIDo" do?   ===

After the initialization, the program:

1) Calls mkdir to create the directory "welcome" and "Welcome/To".

2) Calls open to open the file "OS2018" within "Welcome/To", 
creating it if it does not exist.

3) Calls fstat, presumalbly to check if the file was opened correctly.

4) Calls close to close this file.

5) Calls unlink to remove the reference to this file, essentialy deleting it.

6) Calls rmdir to remove the directorires created in (1) and (2).

7) calls exit_group to terminate all threads in this process, killing the program.
