REMARKS:

Implementation remarks:

    Thread's contexts are implemented as a struct. This struct holds pointers to shared resources,
    as well as the threads unique ID.

    Besides pointers to the input and output vector, there are a few important shared resources:

    The threads share a pointer to a vector-of-vectors, where each thread can use the inner
    IntermediateVec corresponding to it's TID.

    A pointer to an atomic<int> to control access to the inputVec, as well as status flag to
    determine if we wanna put certain thread into sem_wait.
    A pointer to a semaphore used in the shuffle phase.
    A pointer to a boolean everydayImShuffling, used to signal the end of the shuffling.
    And a pointer to a Barrier-class instance.

    The Barrier class holds the mutexes and lock/unlock functions to control access to these
    shared resources.
